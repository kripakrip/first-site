					<p class="main-article__paragraph">From an early age, I have a terribly squeaky 
						voice. It's good that my childhood was not spent in Israel. 
						Every time I cried at night, all the neighbors ran out into 
						the street dressed and with documents. Thought the siren.I had to move. 
						And in the morning my mother took me to kindergarten. 
						I always threw tantrums in the car. And at first, the parents 
						could not figure out where the sound came from, so we did not go to 
						kindergarten, but immediately to the car service, to change the brake pads.
